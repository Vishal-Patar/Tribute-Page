        <h3 class="title text-center font-weight"> Early life and education</h3>
        <ul class="py-4">
            <li><b>B.R. Ambedkar was born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow, a military cantonment in present-day Madhya
                    Pradesh, India. He was born into a family belonging to the Mahar caste, which was considered
                    "Untouchable" in the caste hierarchy prevalent in Indian society. This early exposure to caste-based
                    discrimination deeply influenced his outlook and motivated him to fight for social justice and
                    equality.</b></li>

            <li>Ambedkar's family faced social and economic challenges due to their caste status, but his father's
                determination to provide him with education led him to pursue his studies. </li>

            <li>Education Struggles: Despite facing discrimination and humiliation, Ambedkar showed remarkable academic
                promise from a young age. He faced caste-based discrimination even in school, where he often had to sit
                separately from other students and wasn't allowed to drink water from the same source.</li>

            <li>Scholarship Opportunities: With the help of his father's efforts and the support of some progressive
                teachers, Ambedkar managed to excel in his studies. He secured scholarships that allowed him to continue
                his education. He completed his matriculation from Bombay University in 1907, and his impressive
                performance opened doors for further education.</li>

            <li>Higher Education: Ambedkar's pursuit of higher education led him to the Elphinstone College in Mumbai.
                Despite his academic achievements, he continued to face social ostracism due to his caste. Nevertheless,
                he graduated in 1912 with a degree in economics and political science.</li>

            <li>Studies Abroad: Ambedkar's determination to overcome caste-based limitations led him to pursue
                postgraduate studies abroad. With financial support from the Maharaja of Baroda, he traveled to the
                United States in 1913 to study at Columbia University. He obtained an M.A. in Economics and a Ph.D. in
                1916 for his thesis on the "Problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Its Solution."</li>

            <li>Return to India: After completing his studies abroad, Ambedkar returned to India in 1917 and began
                working as a professor in various institutions. He continued to engage in social and political
                discussions about the rights of marginalized communities.</li>

        <h3 class="title text-center font-weight"> life and work</h3>
        <ul class="py-4">
            <li> <b>Campaign Against Untouchability:</b> Ambedkar was born into a Dalit (formerly known as
                "Untouchable") family and experienced firsthand the oppressive caste system prevalent in India. He
                dedicated his life to fighting against untouchability and the social injustices faced by Dalits. He
                advocated for the rights and dignity of Dalits, challenging the age-old oppressive practices that
                relegated them to the lowest rungs of society..</li>

            <li> <b>Temple Entry Movement:</b> Ambedkar played a significant role in the Temple Entry Movement, which
                aimed to grant Dalits the right to enter Hindu temples and participate in religious activities. He
                believed that access to religious spaces was essential for social integration and equality..</li>

            <li><b>Annihilation of Caste: </b>Ambedkar's seminal work "Annihilation of Caste" critically examined the
                caste system and its injustices. He argued for the complete eradication of the caste system and the
                creation of a just and equal society. He believed that caste divisions perpetuated inequality and
                hindered the progress of the nation.</li>

            <li> <b>Reservation System:</b> Ambedkar was a strong advocate for reservations in education and government
                jobs for historically marginalized communities, including Dalits. He believed that affirmative action
                was necessary to uplift these communities and provide them with opportunities that had been denied to
                them for centuries.</li>

            <li><b>Drafting the Indian Constitution:</b> Ambedkar's most enduring contribution is his pivotal role in
                drafting the Indian Constitution. As the chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, he ensured
                that the Constitution included provisions safeguarding the rights and interests of all citizens,
                regardless of their caste or background. He championed fundamental rights, social justice, and equality
                under the law.</li>

            <li><b>Conversion to Buddhism:</b> Disillusioned with the hierarchical structure of Hinduism and its
                inability to bring about social equality, Ambedkar converted to Buddhism in 1956 along with a large
                number of his followers. This conversion was both a spiritual choice and a political statement against
                the injustices of the caste system.

            <li><b>Drafting the Indian Constitution:</b> Perhaps his most enduring achievement, Ambedkar chaired the
                Constitution Drafting Committee and played a central role in crafting the Indian Constitution. The
                Constitution, adopted on January 26, 1950, enshrined principles of equality, justice, and fundamental
                rights for all citizens, regardless of caste, religion, or background.</li>
            <li><b>Advocacy for Dalit Rights:</b> Ambedkar's lifelong commitment to the rights of Dalits and other
                marginalized communities resulted in significant advancements in their social and political status. His
                efforts contributed to legal reforms, including the abolition of untouchability, and led to increased
                awareness about the rights of oppressed communities.
